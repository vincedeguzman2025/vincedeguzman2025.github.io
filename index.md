## CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1, was a favorite because I had always heard of the term "BMR" and wondered how it was even calculated. Through this lab, I was able to write inputs and outputs, which played a part in calculating a person's BMR. Once you entered a person's weight, height, and age, you were able to find their BMR. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1, was a favorite because I always forget the conversions for mililiters, cups, and tablespoons, and this lab helped me remember them. Through this lab, I was able to use if statements, which helped convert these measurements. Using test cases, my group was able to successfully write code that converted measurements when given a certain amount. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1, was a favorite because it dealt with finding the area of a rectangle, which involves math, a subject I generally enjoy. Through this lab, I was able to use cin and cout, which helped print values and read the values given. My group's code was able to calculate the area, when given its length and width.
